=============================================================

A tool for GUI automation using a variety of computer vision and display
control backends.

Introduction and concepts
-------------------------

In order to do GUI automation you usually need to solve two problems:
first, you need to have a way to control and interact with the interface
and platform you are automating and second, you need to be able to
locate the objects you are interested in on the screen. Guibot helps you
do both.

To interact with GUIs, Guibot provides the
`controller <https://github.com/intra2net/guibot/blob/master/guibot/controller.py>`__
module which contains a common interface for different display backends,
with methods to move the mouse, take screenshots, type characters and so
on. The backend to use will depend on how your platform is accessible,
with some backends running directly as native binaries or python scripts
on Windows, macOS, and Linux while others connecting through remote VNC
displays.

To locate an element on the screen, you will need an image representing
the screen, a
`target <https://github.com/intra2net/guibot/blob/master/guibot/target.py>`__
representing the element (an image or a text in the simplest cases) and
a
`finder <https://github.com/intra2net/guibot/blob/master/guibot/finder.py>`__
configured for the target. The finder looks for the target within the
screenshot image and returns the coordinates to the region where that
target appears. Finders, just like display controllers, are wrappers
around different backends supported by Guibot that could vary from a
simplest 1:1 pixel matching by controller backends, to template or
feature matching mix by OpenCV, to OCR and ML solutions by Tesseract and
AI frameworks.

Finally, to bridge the gap between controlling the GUI and finding
target elements, the
`region <https://github.com/intra2net/guibot/blob/master/guibot/region.py>`__
module is provided. It represents a subregion of a screen and contains
methods to locate targets in this region using a choice of finder and
interact with the graphical interface using a choice of controller.

Supported backends
------------------

Supported Computer Vision (CV) backends are based on

-  `OpenCV <https://github.com/opencv/opencv>`__

   -  Template matching
   -  Contour matching
   -  Feature matching
   -  Haar cascade matching
   -  Template-feature and mixed matching

-  `Tesseract OCR <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract>`__

   -  Text matching through pytesseract, tesserocr, or OpenCVâ€™s bindings

-  `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`__

   -  R-CNN matching through Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN

-  `autopy <https://github.com/msanders/autopy>`__

   -  AutoPy matching

Supported Display Controller (DC) backends are based on

-  `PyAutoGUI <https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui>`__
-  `AutoPy <https://github.com/msanders/autopy>`__
-  `VNCDoTool <https://github.com/sibson/vncdotool>`__
